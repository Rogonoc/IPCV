%  detecting the SURF-features in both images, for which features are 
%  are extracted afterwards. Based on the common features the transformation
%  matrix is estimated from image A to image B.

%  imageA: first image acting as our base
%
%  imageB: second image to which we want to transform our base to
%
%  ptThreshold: threshold value for strength of found features
%       Integer value [0, ->]
%
%  ptROI: specify the Region of Interest over where features should be extracted
%       Rectangle of [cornerTopLeftX cornerTopLeftY width length]
